Feature detection
=================

This guide describes the process of feature detection, which is the first step
done in the analysis of any metabolomics dataset. We start by giving a general
idea of feature detection and then we give an in depth description of each
step.

Feature detection can be defined as the process of detecting interesting
characteristics in data to solve a specific problem. In LC-MS datasets, features
are usually defined as chromatographic peaks, and can be described by retention
time, m/z and peak area, among other descriptors. In TidyMS, feature detection is
done by using an approach similar to the one described by Tautenhahn *et al* in
[1]_, but with some modifications. Loosely, the algorithm can be described
in two steps:

1.  Build regions of interest (ROI) from raw MS data.
2.  Detect chromatographic peaks in each ROI.

Feature detection in a complete MS dataset is done using the
:class:`~tidyms.Assay` object. A guide to working with :class:`~tidyms.Assay`
objects can be found :ref:`here <processing-datasets>`.

For the examples described in this tutorial we use an example file that can be
downloaded using the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import tidyms as ms

    filename = "NZ_20200227_039.mzML"
    dataset = "test-nist-raw-data"
    ms.fileio.download_tidyms_data(dataset, [filename], download_dir=".")

    ms_data = ms.MSData.create_MSData_instance(
        filename,
        ms_mode="centroid",
        instrument="qtof",
        separation="uplc"
    )


.. _roi-creation:

ROI creation
============

ROI are similar to chromatograms but with two differences: information related
to the m/z value used in each scan is included and the traces are defined only
where m/z values were detected.

..  plot:: plots/roi-definition.py
    :caption:   A ROI is defined by three arrays storing information related to
                m/z, time and intensity.

ROIs are built from raw MS data in centroid mode using
:py:func:`tidyms.raw_data_utils.make_roi`, which implements the strategy
described in [1]_. ROIs are created and extended connecting close m/z values
across successive scans using the following method:

1.  The m/z values in The first scan are used to initialize a list of
    ROI. If ``targeted_mz`` is used, the ROI are initialized using this
    list.
2.  m/z values from the next scan extend the ROIs if they are closer
    than ``tolerance`` to the mean m/z of the ROI. Values that don't match
    any ROI are used to create new ROIs and are appended to the ROI
    list. If ``targeted_mz`` is used, these values are discarded.
3.  If more than one m/z value is within the tolerance threshold, m/z and
    intensity values are computed according to the ``multiple_match``
    strategy. Two strategies are available: merge multiple peaks into an
    average peak or use only the closest peak to extend the ROI and create
    new ROIs with the others.
4.  If a ROI can't be extended with any m/z value from the new scan, it is
    extended using NaNs.
5.  If there are more than ``max_missing`` consecutive NaN in a ROI, then
    the ROI is flagged as completed. If the maximum intensity of a completed ROI
    is greater than ``min_intensity`` and the number of points is greater
    than ``min_length``, then the ROI is flagged as valid. Otherwise, the ROI is
    discarded.
6.  Repeat from step 2 until no more new scans are available.

The following example shows how ROI can be created from raw data (an intensity
threshold is used  to reduce the number of ROI created):

.. code-block:: python

    roi_list = ms.make_roi(ms_data, min_intensity=10000)

ROI can be used in the same way as chromatograms as shown
:ref:`here <working-with-raw-data>`:

.. code-block:: python

    roi = roi_list[0]
    roi.fill_nan()
    roi.plot()

.. _feature-extraction:

Extracting chromatographic peaks from a ROI
-------------------------------------------

The complete algorithm for detecting features in a ROI can be described as
follows:

1.  Estimate the noise level in the chromatogram.
2.  Optionally, smooth the chromatogram using a gaussian filter.
3.  Estimate the baseline in the ROI.
4.  Detect peaks in the chromatogram.
5.  Compute descriptors for each detected peak.

Steps 1-4 are done with :meth:`tidyms.lcms.LCRoi.extract_features`, which
builds a list of :class:`tidyms.lcms.Peak` objects where the location of
each detected peak is stored. The `smoothing_strength` parameter controls the
width of the Gaussian curve for smoothing:

.. code-block:: python

    roi.extract_features(smoothing_strength=1.0)

After building a list of peaks, the descriptors for each peak can be computed
using :meth:`tidyms.lcms.LCRoi.describe_features`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> roi.describe_features()
    [{'height': 11817.91, 'area': 74238.66, 'rt': 125.65, 'width': 12.00,
     'snr': 144.93, 'mz': 146.06, 'mz_std': 0.00}]

By default, the following descriptors are computed:

.. csv-table:: Feature descriptors computed by default
   :file: descriptors.csv
   :widths: 30, 70
   :header-rows: 1

Custom descriptors can be computed using the ``custom_descriptors`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

    # custom descriptors must have the following prototype
    def symmetry(roi: ms.lcms.LCRoi, peak: ms.lcms.Peak) -> float:
        # we are defining the symmetry as the quotient between the left
        # and right peak extension
        x = roi.time
        left_extension = x[peak.apex] - x[peak.start]
        right_extension = x[peak.end - 1] - x[peak.apex]
        return left_extension / right_extension
    custom_descriptors = {"symmetry": symmetry}
    descriptors = roi.describe_features(custom_descriptors=custom_descriptors)

    >>> descriptors
    [{'height': 11793.07, 'area': 73998.12, 'rt': 125.63, 'width': 12.00,
      'snr': 154.45, 'mz': 146.06, 'mz_std': 0.00, 'symmetry': 0.48}]

Finally, ``filters`` can be used to filter peaks according to a specific
range for each descriptor. This parameter takes a dictionary of descriptor
names to a tuple of minimum and maximum values. If a descriptor has values
outside this range, the peak is removed. For example, we can remove peaks with
an retention times lower than 150 in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> filters = {"rt": (150, None)}
    >>> descriptors = roi.describe_features(filters=filters)
    >>> descriptors
    []

If no ``filters`` are provided, the default filters are obtained using
:meth:`tidyms.lcms.LCRoi.get_default_filters`, which filters peaks with
SNR lower than 5 and widths outside the range (4 s - 60 s) if the `separation`
attribute of the ROI is ``uplc`` and (10 s - 90 s) if the `separation` is
``hplc``.

Implementation of the peak picking algorithm
--------------------------------------------

In the first release of TidyMS, peak picking worked using a modified version of
the CWT algorithm, described in [2]_. In chromatographic data, and in particular
in untargeted datasets, optimizing the parameters to cover the majority of peaks
present in the data can be a tricky process. Some of the problems that may
appear while using the CWT algorithm are:

1.  sometimes when a lot of peak overlap occurs, peaks are missing. This is
    because peaks are identified as local maximum in the ridge lines from the
    wavelet transform. If the widths selected don't have the adequate
    resolution, this local maximum may not be found. Also, it is possible to
    have more than one local maximum in a given ridgeline, which causes to
    select one of them using ad hoc rules.
2.  The Ricker wavelet is the most used wavelet to detect peaks, as it has been
    demonstrated to work very with gaussian peaks. In LC-MS data, is common to
    find peaks with a certain degree of asymmetry (eg. peak tailing). Using the
    Ricker wavelet in these cases, results in a wrong estimation of the peak
    extension, which in turn results in bad estimates for the peak area.
3.  The interaction between the parameters in the CWT algorithm is rather
    complex, and sometimes it is not very clear how they affect the peak picking
    process. The user must have a clear knowledge of the wavelet transform to
    interpret parameters such as the SNR. Also there are a lot of specific
    parameters to tune the detection of the ridgelines.

These reasons motivated us to replace the CWT peak picking function. The
new peak picking function uses the thoroughly tested function
:py:func:`scipy.signal.find_peaks`. We focused on keeping the function simple
and easy to extend.

Peak detection usually involves detecting the peak apex, but in order to compute
peak descriptors such as area or width, the peak start and end must also be
found. The region defined between the peak start and end is the peak extension.
We decoupled the tasks of detecting peaks and computing peak descriptors.
:py:func:`tidyms.peaks.detect_peaks` returns three arrays, with indices where
start, apex and end of each peak was detected. This is done in five steps:

1.  The noise level in the signal is estimated.
2.  Using the noise level estimation, each point in the signal is classified as
    either baseline or signal. Baseline points are interpolated to build a
    baseline.
3.  Peaks apex are detected using :py:func:`scipy.signal.find_peaks`. Peaks
    with a prominence lower than three times the noise level or in regions
    classified as baseline are removed.
4.  For each peak its extension is determined by finding the closest baseline
    point to its left and right.
5.  If there are overlapping peaks (i.e. overlapping peak extensions),
    the extension is fixed by defining a boundary between the peaks as
    the minimum value between the apex of the two peaks.

..  plot:: plots/peak-definition.py
    :caption: Peak start, apex and end.

Noise estimation
----------------

To estimate the noise and baseline, the discrete signal :math:`x[n]` is modelled
as three additive components:

.. math::
    x[n] = s[n] + b[n] + e[n]

:math:`s` is the peak component, which is deterministic, non negative and small
except regions where peaks are present. The baseline :math:`b` is a
smooth slow changing function. The noise term :math:`e[n]` is assumed to be
independent and identically distributed (iid) samples from a gaussian
distribution :math:`e[n] \sim N(0, \sigma)`.

If we consider the second finite difference of :math:`x[n]`, :math:`y[n]`:

.. math::
    y[n] = x[n] - 2 x[n-1] + x[n-2]

As :math:`b` is a slow changing function we can ignore its contribution. We
expect that the contribution from :math:`s` in the peak region is greater than
the noise contribution, but if we ignore higher values of :math:`y` we can focus
on regions where :math:`s` is small we can say that most of the variation in
:math:`y` is due to the noise:

.. math::
    y[n] \approx (e[n] - 2 e[n-1] + e[n-2])

Within this approximation, we can say that :math:`y[n] \sim N(0, 2\sigma)`.
The noise estimation tries to exploit this fact, estimating the noise from
the standard deviation of the second difference of :math:`x`. The algorithm
used can be summarized in the following steps:

1.  Compute the second difference of :math:`x`, :math:`y`.
2.  Set :math:`p=90`, the percentile of the data to evaluate.
3.  compute :math:`y_{p}` the p-th percentile of the absolute value of
    :math:`y`.
4.  Compute the mean :math:`\overline{y}` and standard deviation
    :math:`S_{y}` of :math:`y` restricted to elements with an absolute
    value lower than :math:`y_{p}`. This removes the contribution of :math:`s`.
5.  If :math:`|\overline{y}| \leq S_{y}` or :math:`p \leq 20` then the noise
    level is :math:`\sigma = 0.5 S_{y}`. Else decrease :math:`p` by 10 and go
    back to step 3.

If the contribution from :math:`s` is not completely removed, the noise
estimation will be biased. Despite this, this method gives a good enough
approximation of the noise level that can be used to remove noisy peaks.

Baseline  estimation
--------------------

Baseline estimation is done with the following approach: first, every point
in :math:`x` is classified as signal if a peak can potentially be found in the
region or as or as baseline otherwise. Then, the baseline is estimated for the
whole signal by interpolating baseline points.

The main task of baseline estimation is then to perform this classification
process. To do this, all local extrema in the signal are searched (including
first and last points). Then, we take all closed intervals defined between
consecutive local maxima and minima (or viceversa) and try to evaluate if there
is a significant contribution to the signal coming from :math:`s` in each
interval. If :math:`j` and :math:`k` are the indices defining one such interval,
then the sum of :math:`x` in the interval is:

.. math::
    \sum_{i=j}^{k}x[i] = \sum_{i=j}^{k} s[i] + b[i] + e[i]

If :math:`l = k - j` is the length of the interval, and assuming that
:math:`b` is constant in the interval we can write:

.. math::
    \sum_{i=j}^{k} x[i] - x[j] = \sum_{i=j}^{k} s[i] - s[j] +
    \sum_{i=j}^{k} e[i] -e[j]

.. math::
    a = \sum_{i=j}^{k} x[i] - x[j] = \sum_{i=j}^{k} s[i] - s[j] + e_{sum}

Where :math:`e_{sum} \sim N(0, \sqrt{2l}\sigma)` (we know :math:`\sigma` from
the noise estimation). We can get an idea of the contribution of :math:`s` by
using the value of :math:`a` as follows: If the signal term is contributing to
:math:`a`, then the probability of obtaining a value greater than :math:`a`
from noise is going to be small. This can be computed in the following way:

.. math::
    P(|e_{sum}| > |a|)= \textrm{erfc} \left (\frac{|a|}{2\sqrt{l}\sigma}
    \right )

An interval is classified as baseline if this probability is greater than 0.05.

Peak detection
--------------

Besides the signal, noise estimation and baseline estimation,
`find_peaks_params` pass parameters to the underlying peak picking function
:py:func:`scipy.signal.find_peaks`. In general, it is not necessary to change
this parameter, since peak filtering is managed at a later stage.

different SNR levels, baseline shapes and peak widths.
